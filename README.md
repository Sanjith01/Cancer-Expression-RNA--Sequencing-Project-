Scientific Question: Cancer is a very prominent disease among mammals; however, since its more relevant in humans in research does this directly translate to humans having more severe/ expressed levels of cancer or do other animals equivalently or express greater levels of expression within cancer cells when sequencing their P53 genes ?

If P53 is a tumor suppresor gene that is highly expressed in mammals then I would like to sequence both human and whale P53 genes to their respective reference genome to see which animal has the cancer gene more highly expressed since they are usually only studied in the context of humans .

Hypothesis: My hypothesis is that through sequencing both humans and whale P53 genes to their reference genome we will get similar results on the expression of the cancer levels if not whales having even higher expressions because they have no means of combatting against the disease.

The data I am using is fasta files from both humans and beluga whales sequenced P53 gene that are from the ncbi website, where I will use pairwise sequencing to sequence both animals to the reference gene and compare their differentially expressed levels of P53 gene
